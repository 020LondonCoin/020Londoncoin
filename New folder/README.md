020LondonCoin, formerly known as o2o, has been re-branded for London England as “020LondonCoin”. 
o2o had originally started out a novelty-coin by its developer for, “online-to-offline” functionality. 
As the coin was nearing deaths’ door; a group of people came together to form a dedicated team, that breathed new life into o2o. 
Now, with future plans in mind, the team is striving to develop a strong community with a secure&reliable usability of 020LondonCoin; as a means to better the e-commerce inside of London and around the globe.

Advantages:
International, we can purchase all O2O services with O2O coins.
Fast, the configuration only needs 1 minute.* (Blockchain download will take longer)
Dedicated development team and investors looking to see this coin succeed!
Old coin/New life, NOT A NEW COIN!
